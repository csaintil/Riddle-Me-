#### README 
The game is about riddle. I ask different ridlle question and you do your best to answer them. Each time you get answer right you gain one point. At the end of the trivia game. You click the peace sign to get your score.

The features, I included in this project are, a next and previous button that become disabled themselves when you reach the end of the questions and a modal that display your score, you can win and lose.

As for pain point,first one was to put each answer in the button, second was to check the user click the right answer and to match wiht the right answer.

The technologies I used were JAVACRIPT,JQUERY,HTML and CSS.

As for my approch, I used an object constructor to create a different new question each time. I hard coded the each answer to  four buttons  and each question because it was only 5 questions. It was more, I would have used a for loop. Next, to check the answer, I created an empty array named score to check whether the user have click the right answer or not. Based on that, I check how true is there inside then i print the score based on may true there is in the array;
